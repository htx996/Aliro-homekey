/**
 * @brief The Matter face of this reader.
 *
 * Aliro never travels over Wi-Fi -- a tap is NFC from start to finish, and the
 * reader in components/aliro_reader is what handles it. What Matter provides is
 * the *provisioning* plane: the standard way a phone ecosystem hands a lock its
 * reader key pair and then enrolls endpoint keys for the phones that may open
 * it. Those two commands, SetAliroReaderConfig and SetCredential, only exist
 * inside the Door Lock cluster (0x0101), which is why this firmware presents
 * itself as a door lock even on a board with no motor attached.
 *
 * This module is the only place that knows about Matter. It is compiled out
 * entirely unless CONFIG_ALIRO_MATTER_ENABLE is set, and the stubs in
 * matter_lock_disabled.c keep every caller compiling either way.
